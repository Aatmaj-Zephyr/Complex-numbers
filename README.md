# Complex-numbers
This contains the complex numbers class. As complex numbers are not supported in Java like in Python, a seprate class complex numbers is required to be made for generating complex numbers. 
You can use the class in the package to make Complex numbers by creating an instance of the class Complex and use the methods easily. Check out the documentation for more details.


This is implemented in Cpp as well. Even operator overloading is implemented! Be sure to check that out too👍
